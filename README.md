# Detecting Fake News with Machine Learning

## General Information
Today, we don't trust all the news we read/hear from social media. All news are not real, right?
How can we detect fake news? There are many ways.
In this notebook I built 4 simple models (KNN, SVM, ...) to easily predict between real and fake news.
Models can be embedded into social/chat apps to prevent/reduce the
spread of fake news.

## Installation
Create a virtual env, then
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all required libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

Activate virtual env and `cd` into directory.
